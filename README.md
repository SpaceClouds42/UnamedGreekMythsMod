# Unamed Greek Myths Mod

## Gorgons

### Spawning
Up to 2 Gorgons spawn in Gorgon huts, 1 Medusa and 1 Stheno. (Should these keep spawning like witches in witch huts, or just the once like shulkers in end cities?) Euryale can be found spawning near deep oceans.

### Petrification
Making eye contact with any Gorgon causes the player to begin the petrification process. During this process, the player slows down and items start popping out of the player. By the time the player is completely petrified, all items will be lost. After a few moments, the player will begin to thaw out, and regain control over the character. If at any point during the thawing process, eye contact is made with a Gorgon, thawing will cease and petrification will begin again. 

While items are popping out of the player, nearby Gorgons will steal them, 1 stack at a time. These can be recovered by killing the Gorgon, but it will only drop 25% of each stack. This percentage increases by 25% with each level of the Looting enchantment.

During the short period when the player is completely petrified, the player will become a statue. While in this form, each body part (head/arms/body/legs) will become individually mineable blocks. If any of the body parts are broken, the player will die, and the rest of the statue can be harvested.

### Gorgon's hut
A structure that spawns in UNDECIDED_BIOME that houses up to 2 Gorgons. 50% chance of 2 spawning, when 1 spawns, 75% chance Stheno, 25% Medusa. The huts contain statue construction tables (needs better name) with a small chance of a body part or two being on the table. The statue construction tables are not craftable, so you might want to steal those on your way out.

### Beheading and drop loot
Only Medusas can be beheaded, and only with a blade infused with the blood of a Gorgon. 1 Gorgon flesh has a 30% chance of dropping when killing any Gorgon. This can be used in a smithing table with any sword to get its Infused variant (eg. Stone Sword -> Infused Stone Sword). (Some sort of red shimmer to infused swords? not sure on specifics for that tho because an infused sword can have regular enchantments too, giving it the purple shimmer).

### Medusa's head
Medusa's head can be worn as helmet to petrify other players, but it will obstruct your view worse than pumpkins, so be careful. (I have more plans for this, but I'm thinking it's starting to become a bit much, still haven't gotten to the statue stuff)

## Statues
> Then stone body parts can be used to create stone golems, basically players that can defend you, kinda like iron golems

im getting lazy and stopping writing this for now.
